## No matter what

No matter what they tell us  
No matter what they do  
No matter what they teach us  
What we believe is true

No matter what they call us  
However they attack  
No matter where they take us  
We'll find our own way back

I can't deny what I believe  
I can't be what I'm not (I know I'll love)  
I know I'll love forever (I know)  
I know no matter what

If only tears were laughter  
If only night was day  
If only prayers were answered (hear my prayer)  
Then we would hear God say

No matter what they tell you  
No matter what they do  
No matter what they teach us  
What we believe is true

And I will keep you safe and strong  
And shelter from the storm (no matter where)  
No matter where it's barren (a dream)  
A dream is being born

No matter who they follow  
No matter where they lead  
No matter how they judge us  
I'll be everyone you need

No matter if the sun don't shine (the sun don't shine)  
Or if the skies are blue (skies are blue)  
No matter what the end is (my life)  
My life began with you

I can't deny what I believe (what I believe)  
I can't be what I'm not (I know, I know)  
I know this love's forever  
That's all that matters now  
No matter what

No, no matter (no, no matter what)  
No, no matter (no, no matter what)  
No, no matter, that's all that matters to me (no, no matter what)  
No, no matter, that's all that matters to me (no, no matter what)  
I know, no matter, that's all that matters to me (no, no matter what)  
I know, no matter, that's all that matters to me (no, no matter what)  
I know, no matter what, that's all that matters to me (no, no matter what)  
I know, no matter what, that's all that matters to me
